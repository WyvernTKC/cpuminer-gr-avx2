1. Requirements:
---------------

Intel Core2 or newer, or AMD Steamroller or newer CPU. ARM CPUs are not
supported.
64 bit Linux operating system. Apple is not supported.

2. Building on linux prerequisites:
-----------------------------------

It is assumed users know how to install packages on their system and
be able to compile standard source packages. This is basic Linux and
beyond the scope of cpuminer-opt. Regardless compiling is trivial if you
follow the instructions.

Make sure you have the basic development packages installed.
Here is a good start:

http://askubuntu.com/questions/457526/how-to-install-cpuminer-in-ubuntu

Install any additional dependencies needed by cpuminer-opt. The list below
are some of the ones that may not be in the default install and need to
be installed manually. There may be others, read the compiler error messages,
they will give a clue as to the missing package.

The following command should install everything you need on Debian based
distributions such as Ubuntu. Fedora and other distributions may have similar
but different package names. 

Ubuntu/Debian:
$ sudo apt-get install build-essential automake libssl-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev libjansson-dev libgmp-dev zlib1g-dev libnuma-dev git

CentOS/Fedora:
$ sudo yum install automake libcurl-devel openssl-devel jansson-devel gmp-devel zlib-devel numactl-devel make gcc gcc-c++ kernel-devel git

Make sure gcc version is above 8. It is required for c++20 support.

SHA support on AMD Ryzen CPUs requires gcc version 5 or higher and
openssl 1.1.0e or higher. Add one of the following to CFLAGS for SHA
support depending on your CPU and compiler version:

"-march=native" is always the best choice

"-march=znver1" for Ryzen 1000 & 2000 series, znver2 for 3000.

"-msha"  Add SHA to other tuning options

Additional instructions for static compilalation can be found here:
https://lxadm.com/Static_compilation_of_cpuminer
Static builds should only considered in a homogeneous HW and SW environment.
Local builds will always have the best performance and compatibility.

3. Download cpuminer-gr-avx2
------------------------

Download the source code for the latest realease from the official repository.

https://github.com/WyvernTKC/cpuminer-gr-avx2/releases

Extract the source code.

$ tar xvzf cpuminer-gr-avx2-X.Y.Z.tar.gz


Alternatively it can be cloned from git.

$ git clone https://github.com/WyvernTKC/cpuminer-gr-avx2
 
4. Build cpuminer-gr
---------------------

It is recomended to Build with default options, this will usuallly
produce the best results.

$ ./build.sh to build on Linux or execute the following commands.

or 

$ ./autogen.sh
For GCC-10+:
$ CFLAGS="-O3 -march=native -mtune=native" CXXFLAGS="$CFLAGS -std=c++20 -Wno-ignored-attributes" ./configure --with-curl
For GCC-8 && GCC-9:
$ CFLAGS="-O3 -march=native -mtune=native" CXXFLAGS="$CFLAGS -std=c++2a -fconcepts -Wno-ignored-attributes" ./configure --with-curl
$ make -j n

n is the number of threads.

5. Start mining.
----------------

$ ./cpuminer -a algo -o url -u username -p password
